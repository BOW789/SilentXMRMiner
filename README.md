# SilentXMRMiner v1.0 - Based on Lime Miner v0.3


## Main Features

* .NET - Coded in Visual Basic .NET, requires .NET Framework 4.5.
 
* Codedom - No need for external libraries to compile

* Injection (Silent) - Hide payload behind another process

* CPU & GPU Mining - Can mine on Both CPU and GPU (Nvidia & AMD)

* Idle Mining - Can be configured to mine with a different Max CPU when computer is idle
  
* Stealth - Pauses the miner while Task Manager is open

* Watchdog - Replaces the miner if removed and starts it if closed down
